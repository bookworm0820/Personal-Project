          <h2>Abstract</h2>
          <p>&nbsp;This is a web page for personal project. Therefore it does not upload to the server. In fact, I did a lot of effort into this site and I can not live without telling the world. But I don't have a computer for server and I don't have the skills to host this site. It's too bad. I need to study more.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;Back to the point, the subject I am taking is advanced web programming. The subject code is ITEC416003 and Professor Ryu, EunKyung teaches this. She is very nice. The Mid-exam of this subject is to submit an HTML files that we produced ourselves. So I made it.</p>

          <h2>Introduce Myself</h2>
          <p>&nbsp;My name is Lee, SeungTae. I am a student of the Department of Library and Information Science at Kyungpook National University's College of Social Sciences. I am in course of convergence major. That is a major of Digital Information Management.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;I have taken Basic Programming class that deals with C and now I am taking this subject with An Introduction to Computer Science. When I first learned C, it was really hard and I did not want to do it. However, as I studied HTML, I gradually reagained my confidence and began to have fun. Of course HTML is difficult enough. But unlike C, HTML shows the result as much as I work harder. That is why I am more into it. An Introduction of Computer Science fills in the parts that have not been understood while taking computer-related classes.</p>

          <h2>Goals</h2>
          <p>&nbsp;The purpose of this project is to collect information about coffee. The reason why I chose this topic is because I am interested in coffee. I passed the test by the SCA(Specialty Coffee Association) presiding officer in 2019. So I am qualified as a European barista.</p>

          <h2>Content</h2>
          <p>&nbsp;Its composition is divided into a brief introduction to coffee, coffee beans, history of coffee and barista skills. I have not even learned about DB and PHP yet, so the information is not automatically updated. Therefor, only one article was written for each content.</p>
